Christian and his wife Karin welcomed me as part of the family. At the same time, I had complete autonomy to use the kitchen, enter/exit, and make myself feel at home without feeling like I was interrupting. The airbnb room, bathroom and kitchen are downstairs while Christian and his family live upstairs. Actually only rarely saw Christian and family. The room has a beautiful balcony. A few anecdotes to illustrate their kindness and hospitality: <br/>- Christian loaned me a bike, which has been terrific for getting around Stockholm. The room was available for a month but I am staying in Stockholm another 2 months. Christian offered to let me continue to use the bike after my stay. <br/>- At one point I left my a bag containing my laptop and passport on the metro. Karin spent at least an hour on Friday at midnight helping me contact the necessary authorities to retrieve the bag. <br/>- Christian and Karin hosted a friends and family dinner with 20+ guests. I was invited to attend, everything was delicious and made several new friends :) <br/><br/>Cannot recommend Christian enough! He also provided lots of information and suggestions around Stockholm. If you are lucky enough to stay at Christian's home do not pass up the opportunity. You will be sure to have a good experience.\",\n"," 'I had a great time staying with Karin and Christian!

In particular we enjoyed the convenient location (the apartment is close to the market, shops, restaurants, pubs, etc.) and the authentic charm of the apartment itself. It is as pictured--very quaint and historic, but also charming and cozy. I highly recommend this place for adults, and for families with older kids (stairs may make it a bit tricky for older guests or toddlers). Also--just a note--there is a bell tower right by the apartment which may (or may not) disturb your sleep. It was really no big deal for us--I just wanted to mention it in case someone is very sound sensitive. It shouldn't be a deal breaker at all--just bring some inexpensive ear plugs and you'll be fine!\",\n"," \"This is the best accommodation in all my travels. Malin is a hospitable host, in her house you don't feel at home as a guest. You're naturally at home. Coffee and fresh herbs in the fridge, ginger biscuits and local soda.

Just to one of the metro stations, although the address on the website showed a completely different place. We trusted Malin and it turned out that she was waiting for us for more than an hour in the cold winter air. Malin shows in detail and tells everything about the house.

Highly recommend.\",\n"," 'We spent some days in Stockholm around New Year\\'s Eve and this house was the perfect choice. We were a larger group of people and felt really at home there!<br/>The house is situated in a calm neighbourhood which looked especially beautiful around the Christmas days due to the decent swedish decoration and lights. We travelled without car and had no problems reaching everything we wanted by metro (\"T-bana\").<br/>On the arrival day the host family waited for us to show us the their house and its functionalities before leaving. One recognizes that the house is actually inhabited (not just an AirBnB house) which gives it a warm and comfortable atmosphere.<br/>The kitchen has got everything one needs to prepare breakfast and meals for several people, as well as the living room hosted our large group for meals and games around the table.<br/><br/>We can totally recommend the house (and the hosts) to everyone - this suits for families and friends as well!',\n"," 'I cannot accurately express how great this place is, but I’ll try. We had reasonable expectations of the place, but after being there a few days we realized how WONDERFUL it is to stay here. It has a great floor plan, it’s clean, has everything you need, and it feels like a home. <br/><br/>What really amazed us is how close it is to the SL (53) bus line, Centralstation and subsequently major attractions. One being Gamla Stan (Old Town), the Christmas Market, the Royal Palace and other beautiful places to visit. <br/><br/>Not only that, but it’s close to local grocery stores (ICA and COOP) for stocking the fridge, and a few Systembolaget stores for alcohol that’s 3.5% and over. <br/><br/>As Americans being in Stockholm for the first time, we naturally had some questions about how to do things and our hosts were EXTREMELY patient, polite and willing to explain. <br/><br/>We look forward to coming back to Stockholm during the summer months and hopefully Elin and Justein will be willing to host us again.',\n"," \"Dmitry's place is unlike any other airbnb/vrbo place I've stayed in that he actually lives there and only rents it out when he's out of town. This means that you get to stay in a HOME rather than a sometimes sterile place that lacks personality. Our family gathered in Stockholm for Christmas, we spent a week at Dmitry's place and were greeted by a living Christmas tree in addition to other seasonal decorations - needless to say, this made us feel right at home! <br/>As other guests have mentioned, this place is a large top floor apartment with expansive views in opposite directions, the two balconies must be absolutely awesome in the spring/summer/fall! The neighborhood is quiet but there is shopping, restaurants and bars within short walking distance. And with Stockholm's great public transportation, everything else is just a bus-, subway-, trainride away. <br/>The kitchen is small but expertly planned so light cooking and cleaning up was a breeze. The dining room table is beyond generous and we spent some quality time eating breakfast, reading and doing crosswords there every morning. <br/>There is no TV per se, but Dmitry graciously lets you use his iMac to stream movies/TV etc. The wifi works great, there's plenty bandwidth for multiple PCs/smartphones.<br/>Communication with Dmitry was quick, easy and pleasant, the check-in/check-out ran like clockwork and we couldn't be happier with our stay!

As we arrived Stockholm on Christmas Eve, most of shops were already closed, Sophia well prepared some food. A big thank you. However, we found this property is a bit too tiny for our family of four, 2 adults and two teenagers (aged 12 & 14), there is no proper living room and the open kitchen is way too tiny. We found it was a bit challenged to cook in the kitchen though.  The power point is too closed to the sink and stove, we felt that was a bit unsafe, always need to be very careful while the PowerPoint and the water tap needed to be in used at the same time. This apartment suits better for family of 3, maybe. Plus if you prefer not cooking. There is no wardrobe, instead there is only a clothing rack but it’s not enough for four of us to hang our winter jackets!',\n"," \"Janu has a lovely little annex.

We also appreciated the stand-alone shower, and, the hall half-bath apart from the main bathroom, as it made getting our group of 7 out the door MUCH easier.  And, the small washer and dryer available in the apartment during our stay were a bonus as we neared the end of our trip. <br/><br/>A few things as reference---We did find there was not much \"comfortable casual seating\" (like a couch) considering the size of the apartment, so some of our group sat on the dining chairs when the two smallish-couches filled.  So if that is important to your group that would be something to inquire with the hosts about prior to booking, in case they make changes to improve that.   Also, as with many of these historic buildings, you will only have stair access, no elevators, to the flat on the 4th floor.  We had one issue with the wi-fi connection, but the host team responded very quickly with a solution, so we appreciated that. <br/><br/>We enjoyed our stay, and would consider staying again!',\n"," 'Perfect location, gorgeous room (even better than the photos).

And since it was just before Christmas, there was a Christmas market setup in front of the Noble Peace museum, less than a 5 minute walk from the apartment. To see the Vasa ship, Abba museum or the Christmas market at Skansen was a 15 minute walk to the docks and then a short ferry ride to the other side.<br/>The apartment seemed large by comparison to other apartments we had seen.

At night this was magical seeing Christmas lights in the gardens of the surrounding pretty houses from the cozy location of our kitchen/dining area. The kids loved the kid-friendly nature of the house including toys, puzzles, books, crayons, a trampoline in the garden and even gymnastics rings in one of the bedrooms! The kitchen was fully kitted-out enabling us to cook and easily host local family on some occasions. The sauna in the basement was also a treat.

We did not meet her because she left us the keys. The house is exactly as in the pictures, very pretty and furnished in a cheerful and colored style. We were on New Year's Eve so we could appreciate the typical Christmas lighting that we found already turned on when we arrived at home: electric candles, decorations, typical Swedish stars.<br/>It is not a huge or luxurious apartment, but for us that were 4, was very good: the parents had their bedroom with double bed and the two daughters their room with 2 single beds. The only drawback that we didn't appreciate was the size of the bathroom: it was very very tiny, just enough to sit down, with the sink that cluttered the little space available. But, luckily, there was another bathroom,  only with sink and shower. <br/>Few wardrobes to accommodate our dressing: we left many clothes in suitcases. The kitchen was a part of the living room, with 4 electric burner stove. Very functional and practical. For us italians, using to cook a lot, suffered from the lack of adequate pots and a colander for PASTA! <br/>For the rest, very beautiful and brand new dishes and glasses, still with the brand's sticker!

Navigating Stockholm from here is an easy ride by metro or ferry. The location and atmosphere cannot be beat! We also just LOVED coming into such a warm, cozy apartment after being out in the cold. The apartment is very charming, with wide wood plank floors and etchings of country barns. It reminded me of a warm country cottage. There is a preschool across the street and another school a few blocks away, so sounds of children often fill the street. I loved hearing that. We did not have a lack hot water which some of the other commenters mentioned, but we were aware of this so we alternated our showers to conserve hot water.

It's nothing bad about the house, it's just a fact. We would definitely stay here again. Do make sure you go to the bakery. You can walk there on the way to the Metro/Grocery.

Street closures can impact your ability to reach the apartment by taxi.<br/>The layout of the apartment is good for 3 couples or a family.

We're also hopeful that more written instructions may be available for heat and cooling regulation, as well as the use of the TV. (especially if you're hoping to watch a movie with children).

The beds are super comfy, the bedrooms are spacious and well thought out and the heating throughout the house is fantastic, especially when you're not used to temperatures below 5degrees! The kitchen is equipped with absolutely everything you need to bake or cook whatever your heart desires. It is a 10-15min walk from the closest train station, but the trains come regularly and are direct to the city. host is a friendly, welcoming host that is more than willing to go out of his way to help with anything you need and helped us to sort it a Christmas tree, decorations and Christmas lights which made for a fantastic Swedish Christmas.

Des chambres nombreuses ( au moins 4 à lit double + un grand local sous toiture avec large baie vitrée permettant d'héberger sans problème un couple avec 3 enfants) avec accès privatif permettent un  séjour d'une quinzaine de personnes au total garantissant à la fois la possibilité de se retrouver dans des espaces communs (une cuisine avec coin repas pour 6 à 8 personnes, une salle à manger avec une table pouvant accueillir de 10 à 12 convives, un vaste salon permettant de se retrouver sans être serrés  ...) et la possibilité de s'isoler dans des espaces privatifs (chambres) accessibles sans avoir à passer par les espaces communs. Deux terrasses de part et d'autre de la maison permettent de profiter du jardin côté accès, de la forêt du côté opposé. \\r<br/>L'ambiance est très chaude, avec des points d'éclairage nombreux dont la plupart sont équipés de gradateurs permettant la modulation de l'ambiance lumineuse.\\r<br/>Le propriétaire (host) est un homme très courtois, polyglotte (anglais, allemand, suédois au moins), très accessible (sur les lieux, dans une dépendance à dix mètres de la mlaison qu'il loue), avec une vaste culture qui lui permet de s'adapter à des personnes d'origines très diverses, ce qui facilite largement le contact. Très confiant à l'égard de ses hôtes, l'accueil qu'il leur prodigue est extrêmement chaleureux. L'accès à Stockholm est très facile par la ligne 3 du métro à partir de la station svedmyra, à moins de dix minutes à pied . Une ligne de bus permet aussi si on le souhaite d'éviter quasi totalement la marche à pied.

There is nothing wrong with the property or location unfortunately we were just very let down by the host for this villa on the first night of a special occasion. A big group us planned a surprise trip for my sisters 40th birthday, unfortunately had our first day and arrival dampened as we were locked out with no help. Our host didn't respond to any of my messages that day so I wasn't sure what was happening for check in. I wasn't too worried as he is a super host and so I was under the impression he was meeting us as he didn't supply any additional details or provide any communication at all that day or the day before for check in at 4pm. We arrived to the house in the rain and thunder and no one was there to meet us and the front door was locked. I tried calling and messaging the host many times with no response at all. It had a coded door so we read the manual on the website and hoped he set the code according to the manual - nothing was set. We were stuck out in the suburbs with our luggage in the rain on a Friday, not an ideal start to a surprise birthday weekend break. Two of our party were pregnant and highly uncomfortable, so I felt awful for them as it is the suburbs there was no where for them to go and sit to wait or use the loo while we sorted out the problem. I called air bnb once I realised we weren't going to hear from our host and they were helpful, my contact was lovely and sympathetic. They were trying to contact the host too with no luck. We tried all the doors and found a side door which luckily wasn't locked and got in the house. We felt a bit uncomfortable going into the house via an unlocked side door but were reassured this was ok by the air bnb help desk. We had to leave our luggage in the house unsecured and unlocked as we had a birthday dinner planned in the city and we didn't want to stay in. We ended up missing our dinner reservations for my sister's birthday party which was disappointing, so we ended up walking around until we found somewhere that would take a big group at that time on a Friday night. We didn't hear from the host until 9pm, which is 5 hours from check in and we finally got a code for the locked front door that we could use the rest of the weekend.
